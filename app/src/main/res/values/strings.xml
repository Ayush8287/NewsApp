        <string name="About_Us">
       <br> - We basically intend to design a android application named Community4You which gather information about various communities together on a single platform.\n\n</br>
        <br>
        - We hope to address the issue of lack of guidance by providing students with information about the community, such as how to contact them based on their interests and needs.\n\n</br>
<br>
        - Also, parents can benefit from such an app by easily accessing the right guidance of the field their child demands that they might not have.\n\n</br>
